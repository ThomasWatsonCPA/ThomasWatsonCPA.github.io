        <p class="project__description">
          For this project, I created an automation tool for calculating the contribution allocation for certain union employees. The allocation is based upon the Company's 
          collective bargaining agreement, where certain employees belonging to "Union A" will receive a portion of a total contribution pool paid by the Company each quarter.  
        </p>
        <p class="project__description">
          <li>The specifics of the employer's contribution allocation are as follows:</li>
          <li>The "contribution pool" is 7% of all "Union A" employees gross compensation for the quarter</li>
          <li>The pool of funds includes the wages of both active and terminated employees</li>
          <li>The allocation for each employee is based on allocated years of service as a percentage of total allocated years of service for the group</li>
          <li>The allocation years of service is based on the employee's years of service from hire date to allocation date (last day of quarter)</li>  
          <li>If an employee in the group has worked 5 years or less, the employee receives 5 years of allocation service automatically</li>
        </p>

            <p class="project__step-description">
              The client typically provides us with a quarterly file that contains the data necessary to determine the allocation. This file contains names, status, classification,
              wages, etc. However, it is often provided in various formats that might include capitalization and other structural differences. The first step involved was cleaning
              this file into a usable, templatized format. Below is an example of what this file usually looks like (post-cleaned):   
            </p>

            <p class="project__step-description">
              The first order of business was to filter out any employees that are not participants in Union A. In addition, there are many blank term date cells since only a handful 
              of employees terminated during the quarter. For these blank values, we will replace all blanks with a date in the infinite future (12/31/9999). While replacing the blank
              term date values isn't really necessary, I like to do it anyways just for the sake of ease and future use. For example, we could add a simple validation operation to 
              determine if the term date is before or after the allocation date since the employee must be actively employed on the allocation date. This could be beneficial if the 
              data set grew larger or messier.

            <p class="project__step-description">
              To validate the data is accurate and complete, we can simply compare the number of Union A employees in our sorted data to the number of Union A employees in the original  
              data file. There were 23 total Union A employees, of which, 4 were terminated. The data in the tool agrees to the original data; therefore, we can move to the next step.

            <p class="project__step-description">
              The next step is to assign each employee with their years of service allocation. Basically what we achieve with this step is to calculate the number of years between the 
              employee's hire date and the allocation date. The number of years has to be rounded DOWN to the nearest whole year. When the years of allocation service are calculated, 
              a simple operation has to be performed to determine if that number is greater than or equal to 5 or not. If not, the allocated years of service for the employee must 
              automatically be 5.  
            </p>
            <p class="project__step-description">
              Here is the custom M Code function in Power Query to achieve this result:  
            </p>
            <pre><code>
          let
              CalculateAllocationYears = (HireDate as date, AllocationDate as date) as number =>
          
              let 
                  DifferenceInDays = Duration.Days(Duration.From(AllocationDate - HireDate)),
                  DifferenceInYears = DifferenceInDays / 365,
                  RoundedDifferenceInYears = Number.RoundDown(DifferenceInYears, 0),
                  AllocatedYears = if RoundedDifferenceInYears <= 5 then 5 else RoundedDifferenceInYears
              in 
                  AllocatedYears
          in
              CalculateAllocationYears</code></pre>
