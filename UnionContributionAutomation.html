        <p class="project__description">
          For this project, I created an automation tool for calculating the contribution allocation for certain union employees. The allocation is based upon the Company's 
          collective bargaining agreement, where certain employees belonging to "Union A" will receive a portion of a total contribution pool paid by the Company each quarter.  
        </p>
        <p class="project__description">
          <li>The specifics of the employer's contribution allocation are as follows:</li>
          <li>The "contribution pool" is 7% of all "Union A" employees gross compensation for the quarter</li>
          <li>The pool of funds includes the wages of both active and terminated employees</li>
          <li>The allocation for each employee is based on allocated years of service as a percentage of total allocated years of service for the group</li>
          <li>The allocation years of service is based on the employee's years of service from hire date to allocation date (last day of quarter)</li>  
          <li>If an employee in the group has worked 5 years or less, the employee receives 5 years of allocation service automatically</li>
        </p>

            <p class="project__step-description">
              The client typically provides us with a quarterly file that contains the data necessary to determine the allocation. This file contains names, status, classification,
              wages, etc. However, it is often provided in various formats that might include capitalization and other structural differences. The first step involved was cleaning
              this file into a usable, templatized format. Below is an example of what this file usually looks like (post-cleaned):   
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="project__step-description">
              The first order of business was to filter out any employees that are not participants in Union A. In addition, there are many blank term date cells since only a handful 
              of employees terminated during the quarter. For these blank values, we will replace all blanks with a date in the infinite future (12/31/9999).   
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="project__step-description">
              To validate the data is accurate and complete, we can simply compare the number of Union A employees in our sorted data to the number of Union A employees in the original  
              data file. There were 23 total Union A employees, of which, 4 were terminated. The data in the tool agrees to the original data; therefore, we can move to the next step.

            <h3 class="project__step-heading">Step 2: Calculate allocated years of service</h3>
            <p class="project__step-description">
              The next step is to assign each employee with their years of service allocation. Basically what we achieve with this step is to calculate the number of years between the 
              employee's hire date and the allocation date. The number of years has to be rounded DOWN to the nearest whole year. When the years of allocation service are calculated, 
              a simple operation has to be performed to determine if that number is greater than or equal to 5 or not. If not, the allocated years of service for the employee must 
              automatically be 5. If the employee was terminated they are allocated zero years.  
            </p>
            <p class="project__step-description">
              Here is the custom M Code function in Power Query to achieve this result:  
            </p>
            <pre><code>
          let
              CalculateAllocationYears = (HireDate as date, AllocationDate as date, TermDate as date) as number =>
          
              let 
                  DifferenceInDays = Duration.Days(Duration.From(AllocationDate - HireDate)),
                  DifferenceInYears = DifferenceInDays / 365,
                  RoundedDifferenceInYears = Number.RoundDown(DifferenceInYears, 0),
                  AllocatedYears = if RoundedDifferenceInYears <= 5 then 5 else if TermDate < AllocationDate then 0 else RoundedDifferenceInYears
                  
              in 
                  AllocatedYears
          in
              CalculateAllocationYears</code></pre>
            <p>
              
            </p>
            <p class="project__step-description">
              And here is the calculation for each employee now shown in our table:

          </li>

          <li class="project__step">
            <h3 class="project__step-heading">Step 3: Determining employee's contribution allocation</h3>
            <p class="project__step-description">
              The final step in the process is calculating the contribution each employee should receive based on their allocated years of service. For this calculation, there are 
              a few operations that need to be completed. First, the contribution pool is 7% of the total gross wages for all active and terminated Union A employees. Second, each 
              employee will receive a pro-rata share of the contribution pool based on their allocated years of service. Third, each employee's contribution will be calculated by 
              multiplying the contribution pool by the employee's pro-rata allocated years of service.    
            </p>
            <p class="project__step-description">
              All of this can be performed in a fairly simple Power Query function:  
            </p>
            <img src="./images/Union_Allocation/Employee Allocation Formula.png" class="project__step-image" alt="Formula for Employee Allocation" />

            <!--<pre><code>// Your code snippet here</code></pre> -->
            <p>
              
            </p>
            <p class="project__step-description">
              The result is the addition of the Employee Allocation column which shows each employee's prorata share of the 7% of total gross wages (contribution) for the quarter:

            </p>
            <p class="project__step-description">
              To do a final validation check, manual calculations were performed to ensure the result was the same:  
            </p>

            <p class="project__step-description">
              Now going forward, when the client sends the data file, we can simply update the source of our query to the new file (or copy/paste the data into a pre-structured template), 
              and refresh. All of our calculations are performed and the final result is presented within a few clicks.
